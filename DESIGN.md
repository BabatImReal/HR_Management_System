Project Overview
Project Name:
Employee Management System

Description
This project is designed to manage employee data within a company, including departments, job roles, salaries, and other employee-specific information. The system provides functionalities for inserting, updating, and querying employee-related data.

Database Schema Design
Tables
Employees

Purpose: Stores information about employees.
Columns:
id: Integer, Primary Key, Auto-increment
department_id: Integer, Foreign Key referencing Departments
job_id: Integer, Foreign Key referencing Jobs
manager_id: Integer, Foreign Key referencing Employees
salary_id: Integer, Foreign Key referencing Salaries
first_name: String
last_name: String
email: String, Unique
phone_number: String
password: String, Encrypted
performance: String, Enum ('Excellent', 'Good', 'Average', 'Bad')
start_date: Date
Departments

Purpose: Stores information about different departments within the company.
Columns:
id: Integer, Primary Key, Auto-increment
department_name: String
Jobs

Purpose: Stores information about different job roles within the company.
Columns:
id: Integer, Primary Key, Auto-increment
job_title: String

Salaries

Purpose: Stores salary information for different job roles.
Columns:
id: Integer, Primary Key, Auto-increment
amount: Decimal

Managers

Purpose: Stores information about managers who supervise employees.
Columns:
id: Integer, Primary Key, Auto-increment
employee_id: Integer, Foreign Key referencing Employees

Relationships
One-to-Many:

Departments to Employees: Each department can have multiple employees.
Jobs to Employees: Each job can have multiple employees.
Salaries to Employees: Each salary can be associated with multiple employees.
Managers to Employees: Each manager supervises multiple employees.
Self-Referential:

The manager_id in the Employees table is a foreign key that references the id in the same Employees table, indicating that an employee can manage other employees.
